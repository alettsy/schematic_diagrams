- [Creating an issue](#creating-an-issue)

## Tools

You can use the default `flutter` command for most things, but it might be a little more straightforward to use [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

Some shorthand `just` commands:

- Run pre-push checks: `just before_commit` or `just bc`
- Run desktop build: `just run_desktop` or `just rd`
- Run all tests: `just test` or `just t`
- Run test coverage: `just test_coverage` or `just tc`

## Commiting

Before you commit or push up your changes, please run the pre-commit checks (`just bc`).

For commit messages, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guide.

For example, your commit message might look like:

- `feat: add dynamic link strategy`
- `fix: incorrect text block position`
- `test: standard link strategy`
- And so on...

## Creating the PR

Before you make your PR, make sure all tests and checks pass by running the pre-commit checks (`just bc`).

When creating the PR, please provide clear details as to the reason for the PR, such as what issue it fixes or the features that it adds.

## Creating an issue

When making an issue or feature request, please provide clear, concise details as to your request.

For example, a _feature request_ may include:

1. Brief overview of feature
2. Why the feature would be useful
3. Whether or not you intend to add the feature
